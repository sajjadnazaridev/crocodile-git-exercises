# exercises-git-crocodile

This project is done as a group exercise to learn the basics of working with Git and GitHub. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to work with branches, make changes, manage pull requests, and resolve conflicts in a real collaboration environment.

## Project structure

This project includes an index.html file that each member of the group has made changes to. Each member of the group created a branch with his own name, applied his changes and then added it to the main branch through a pull request.

### Changes made

- **index.html**:
 - This file contains three paragraphs (`<p>`), each created by a team member.
 - Each team member has added a dedicated paragraph:
 - **Mani**: `<p>This code created by Mani</p>`
 - **Kourosh**: `<p>this code created by kourosh</p>`
 - **Sajjad**: ``<p>hello guten tag</p>`
